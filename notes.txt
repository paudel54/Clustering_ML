1. Create virtual environment

python -m venv clustering_env
source clustering_env/bin/activate 

2. pip freeze > requirements.txt
It will update the requirements.txt file with latest installed packages.




PCA: dimensionality reduction: 
We started 6 time-domain features per ECG window (mean, variance, median, skewness, kurtosis, zcr). 
That's 6-dimensional space is impossible to visualize directly. 
So, PCA found the two directions (linear combinations of these features) that explain the most variance across all windows.
PCA finds the directions of maximum variance in the data (principal components).
n_components=2 keeps the first two directions, giving a 2-D projection of your 6-D feature space.


Explained variance ratio: 
PC1 explains 55 % of the total variation.
PC2 explains 25 %.
Together 80 % of what’s happening in your 6-D feature space is visible in this 2-D plot.
So, your 2D visualization preserves most of the information — a strong indication your features capture the main patterns.

SCORES::
| Silhouette Value | Interpretation                                       |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **+1**           | Perfectly separated clusters (very strong structure) |
| **0.7–1.0**      | Excellent clustering                                 |
| **0.5–0.7**      | Good, well-separated clusters                        |
| **0.25–0.5**     | Acceptable but clusters overlap                      |
| **0–0.25**       | Weak structure, not very meaningful                  |
| **< 0**          | Wrong clustering; samples assigned to wrong clusters |


High silhouette (~1) means:
→ points are tightly grouped in their cluster
→ and far from other clusters
→ excellent, meaningful grouping

Silhouette near 0 means:
→ clusters overlap
→ not very meaningful

Negative silhouette means:
→ many points are closer to another cluster than their own
→ bad clustering
